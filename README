This Package provides basic XMPP protocol support in GO.

================================================================================
 REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================
-Currently Depends on XMLX (https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-pkg-xmlx)

================================================================================
 USAGE
================================================================================

 $ cd /path/to/code/dir
 $ git clone http://github.com/krutcha/go-jabber.git
 $ cd go-jabber
 $ make

================================================================================
 API
================================================================================

 There are examples in the /example directory demonstrating use of the 
 go-jabber pkg to interract with an xmpp server.  Also there is a diagram
 in /doc/gojabber.odg which gives the jist of how the client pkg is meant
 to work.
 
 step 1: open a connection to the XMPP server
         
         jcon, err := gojabber.SpawnConnection(host, domain, 
                      username, password, port, useTLS)
         
         This will open a connection and begin the authentication process,
         obtain a roster, and begin to recieve presence updates.  jcon is
         a struct containing useful connection related information.
         
step 2: register callbacks

        currently 4 callbacks are supported and can be registered as follows:

        -1 avatar updates - user photo has changed
        jcon.ConnectHook_AvatarUpdate(
            func(host string, avatar gojabber.AvatarUpdate) {code})

        -2 incoming messages - chat messages from users
        jcon.ConnectHook_Msg(
            func(host string, msg gojabber.MessageUpdate) {code})

        -3 typing notification - if a user is actively typing a message to you
        jcon.ConnectHook_Typing(
            func(host string, JID string) {code})

        -4 status updates - online, offline, away etc
        jcon.ConnectHook_Status(
            func(host string, JID string, status string) {code})
        
 step 3: call call commands
 
         just 2 commands supported right now to call on a jabber connection:
         
         -1 Disconnect() - kill off the connection, clean up it's channels etc
         -2 SendMessage(msg string, contact *Contact, fromJID string)
                         - send a chat message to a user

 For examples of use of all of the above, see /example/command_line.go 
 
 KNOWN ISSUES: 
       -sync mechanisms added for access to shared JabberCon structs are not 
        enforced
